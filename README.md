# Bloom---Mental-Health-App
Final Hi Fi prototype as a result of the evaluations of the Lo Fi prototype (https://marvelapp.com/prototype/9ji4g1d)
Bloom is a mental health app made primarily for users that want to take care/ improve their mental wellbeing. The programme provided on this app is quite unique and very contemporary in terms of modern psychological techniques for producing good emotional state. Within the app, the user choose from the given categories and listen to different meditations by concern. Also, the user may enter the CBT zone, where he/she can do some CBT exercises by following the written instructions. Also, the user has a personal “Me” section, where he/she can receive an affirmation quote and write into the personal diary. The home page leads to the meditations as core subject of the app, but still the easiest navigation for the users would be the navigation bar, from where all of the web pages can be accessed. Everyone with basic computer skills should log in to the app easily, and for those who need more explanation there is a “Help” section added to the navigation bar on the home page.
